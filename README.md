# Superhero App

## Overview
This is a simple iOS app built with UIKit that lets users generate random superheroes and view their details. Users can also add their favorite heroes to a list.

## Features

## Challenges & Solutions
1. **Overlapping UI Elements**: Adjusted layout constraints to prevent buttons from covering hero details.
2. **API Response Time**: Implemented loading indicators for a better user experience.
3. **Data Persistence**: Used Core Data to ensure favorite heroes are saved even after app restarts.

## Future Improvements
